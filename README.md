# Application for Analysis of Data from Bank Transactions
The goal of this thesis is to design and implement a web application for analyzing bank
transactions. The application uses the Flask web framework on the server and the React
framework on the client. The focus of the work was simplicity and user experience. The
main function of this application is automatic categorization of transactions using artificial
intelligence. The core of this feature is a two-layer architecture. In this architecture we
were able to achieve a success rate of 85 %. This application allows the user to upload a
monthly statement and view a summary graph with the category where they spend the most
money. In addition, the user can compare each month and think about how to optimize
their finances.

You can use live version of this application [MoneyTracker](https://moneytracker.petrhybl.com/).

# Installation

### Requirements
See the docs for installation

* [*npm 8.15*](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8?v=true)

* [*python 3.9*](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

* [*pip*](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

## Frontend Installation 

```
npm install
```

## Backend Installation 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

## Frontend usage 
This command will start the client.
```
npm start
```
You can customize the client with the server address in `source/frontend/package.json` in variable `proxy`.

## Backend usage
This command will start the server. I recommend using virtual environment for python. See [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
```
python3.9 server.py
```
Make sure you have installed and configure the MariaDB/MySQL connector and database correctly on your machine. If you did not setup your database on your local machine you can use database server which is configured in `server.py`.

## Database usage
In `server.py` you can create MariaDB on your localhost or connect to a database hosted on DigitalOcean.
```
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://doadmin:AVNS_1pwKNp83B6jRv800f11@db-mysql-fra1-27117-do-user-11965733-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/defaultdb'
```
